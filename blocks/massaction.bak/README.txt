This is the Mass Actions block for Moodle 2.4 to 2.7. Its appearance and behaviors
are largely the same as the version for Moodle 1.9.

Created at University of Minnesota by the Custom Solutions team.

To install using git, type this command in the root of your Moodle install
    git clone git@github.com:at-tools/moodle-block_massaction.git

Alternatively, download the zip from
    https://github.com/at-tools/moodle-block_massaction/zipball/master
unzip it into the blocks folder, and then rename the new folder to massaction.


Once installed, capability "block/massaction:use" needs to be added to the roles/users
(e.g. teacher) in order for them to be able to use the block.
